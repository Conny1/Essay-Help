            The HISET, or High School Equivalency Test, is a comprehensive exam
            designed to assess academic knowledge and skills equivalent to those
            of a high school graduate. It consists of five sections: Language
            Arts – Reading, Language Arts – Writing, Mathematics, Science, and
            Social Studies. To pass the HISET, you need to score at least 8 out
            of 20 on each of the five subtests and achieve a combined score of
            at least 45 out of 100. At ExamAidHub.com, we're here to help you
            achieve an overall score of 80+ in the HISET test, ensuring success
            and opening doors to better educational and career opportunities.

            The HISET aims to grant a high school equivalency credential,
            providing pathways to higher education, improved career prospects,
            and personal growth. Widely recognized by educational institutions
            and employers, it's equivalent to a traditional high school diploma,
            offering opportunities for college admissions, vocational training,
